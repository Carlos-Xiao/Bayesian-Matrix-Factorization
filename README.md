## Implementation

The implementation codes are organized within the 'src/' folder:

- EDA.ipynb: Executes Exploratory Data Analysis, generating insightful plots;
- bpmf.ipynb: Implements the traditional BPMF process and produces results in "prototype....csv";
- bpmf_update.ipynb: Implements an updated BPMF process, generating results in "full....csv";
- GMM.ipynb: Combines GMM with the updated BPMF process, , generating results in "gmm....csv";
- visual.ipynb: visualize the previously generated results.
